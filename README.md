# guess-number-game
A simple guess the number game has been simulated using Python 3.

Here are the steps:

1- In this particular code, user must specify a number from 1 up to 99 before the game starts. (You can declare your own range by chaning min & max variable in the source file)

2- Then, the computer makes a guess shown in terminal

3- User helps him by giving three valid inputs which are : 
 
    1- 'k', if your number is less than the guess.
    
    2- 'b', if you number is greater than the guess.
    
    3- 'd', if your number is as same as the guess, which results in terminating the program.

Enjoy!
